# This script WILL NOT RUN unless your Execution Policy is set to 
# "Unrestricted" which allows your system to run PowerShell scripts that 
# aren't signed.  If you get an UnauthorizedAccess exception when trying
# to run this script, do the following:
# 
# 1) Open Powershell as an Administrator (left as an exercise to the reader)
# 2) Type: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
# 3) The system will give you a warning. Read it, and if you understand and 
#      accept select Y.
# 4) Close your PowerShell session and re-open a new Powershell Administrator
#      session.
# 5) Run this script from the top of the engine source: & .\setup.ps1
# 6) Optional: Repeat steps 1-4 but change "Unrestricted" to "Restricted" if 
#      you'd like to restore your Execution Policy to the default setting.
